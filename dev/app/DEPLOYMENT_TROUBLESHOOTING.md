# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Build**: Compiling successfully in ~2-3 seconds
✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors
✅ **Local Dev**: Works perfectly on localhost:3000
❌ **Vercel Production**: User reports "not working"

## Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Environment Variables
The app is designed to work WITHOUT Supabase, but if you want multiplayer features, you need:

**Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

Add these variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**After adding variables**: Trigger a new deployment for them to take effect.

### 2. Check Browser Console for Errors
1. Open your deployed Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for any red error messages
5. Take screenshot and share

### 3. Check Vercel Deployment Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Go to "Runtime Logs" tab
4. Look for any errors during server startup or requests
5. Share any error messages

### 4. Test Specific Routes
Try accessing each route individually:
- Home: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
- Student Menu: `https://your-app.vercel.app/menu`
- Teacher Dashboard: `https://your-app.vercel.app/conductor`
- Play Page: `https://your-app.vercel.app/play`

**For each route, note:**
- Does the page load at all?
- Is it a blank page?
- Is there an error message?
- What shows in browser console?

### 5. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Blank White Screen
**Cause**: Client-side JavaScript error
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors

#### Issue: "Database not available" messages
**Cause**: Missing Supabase environment variables
**Solution**: Add environment variables in Vercel settings (Step 1 above)

#### Issue: Page loads but game doesn't start
**Cause**: Phaser game initialization error
**Solution**: Check browser console, may need HTTPS for certain features

#### Issue: Routes return 404
**Cause**: Vercel configuration issue
**Solution**: Check vercel.json and next.config.js are committed

### 6. Verify Build Configuration

Check that these files are committed to git:
- `vercel.json` ✓
- `next.config.js` ✓
- `package.json` ✓

### 7. Manual Testing Checklist

**Without Supabase** (single-player mode):
- [ ] Can create room on `/conductor`
- [ ] Game loads and shows menu scene
- [ ] Can interact with game objects
- [ ] No console errors

**With Supabase** (multiplayer mode):
- [ ] Can join room with code from `/menu`
- [ ] Real-time updates work between teacher/student
- [ ] Chat messages sync
- [ ] Journal entries sync

## Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Deploy Without Multiplayer (Offline Mode)
The app is designed to work without Supabase. Just create a room on `/conductor` and it uses local state.

**No configuration needed** - should work immediately.

### Option B: Enable Full Multiplayer
1. Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Get URL and anon key from project settings
3. Add to Vercel environment variables
4. Redeploy

## Next Steps

Please provide the following information:
1. **Exact Vercel URL**: What URL are you accessing?
2. **What you see**: Blank page? Error message? Screenshot?
3. **Which route**: /, /menu, /conductor, /play?
4. **Browser console errors**: Press F12, check Console tab, share errors
5. **Supabase configured?**: Do you have NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_* environment variables set in Vercel?

With this information, I can pinpoint the exact issue and provide a specific fix.
