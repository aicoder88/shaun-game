So the verb after it stays in its base form (like "kill" not "killed"). Think of it like this: "did" = past time marker. "kill" = action. We don\'t need TWO past markers!

It could be a statement, a question, nobody knows! "Did" is like turning on a spotlight that says "QUESTION TIME!" Compare: "You kill the victim." (sounds weird) vs "Did you kill the victim?"

You\'ve mastered one of the most important structures in English!',
